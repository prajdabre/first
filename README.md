first
=====

[@remote] My first repo at github. Let's do this.

[@remote] This is my first edit to github. I already know about SVN but i guess I amout of practice.

[@remote] Does syncing work???

[@local] So it seems that I have managed to sync from remote to local.
[@local] Now shall I try to sync from local to remote???

[@local] This readme shall stand as a testament.

[@remote] Hey... looks like I managed to create, add and commit a folder and a file to the local repo and sync it to this remote repo. Let me now synch this updated README to the local repo. And that's all for now. Next I will try to learn about higher level stuff like forks and the likes.
